Liar's Dice basic gameplay
Each player starts with 5 dice.
During a player's turn, s\he may make a bid, call the previous player a liar, or declare the previous bid to be spot-on.
If a bid is made, it must be higher than the previous bid.
If "Liar" is called, either the player who called it, or the player it was called against will lose a die, depending on whether the bid was a lie.
If "Spot-On" is called, all dice are taken into account:
	If the bid is exactly right across all dice, all players except the person who called loses a die.
	Otherwise the person who called it loses 2 dice.
The game ends when only one player is left with dice.
